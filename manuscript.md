# Introduction
Developing precise and accurate models that relate stratigraphic position to absolute age (e.g., age-depth models) is a crucial step in interpreting the rate and tempo of geologic and climatological processes [@blaauw2012; @parnell2011]. Constructing these chronologies relies on a variety of geochronologic information. Various radioisotopic techniques (e.g., ^40^Ar/^39^Ar, U-Pb) allow the age of discrete stratigraphic points to be determined. 



# Statistical Methods 

$$P(parameters~|data) = \frac{P(data~|parameters)}{P(data)} \times P(parameters)$$


In our case, our data takes two forms. First, our cyclostratigraphic proxy record, which consists measurements $[d_1, d_2, ... d_i]$ where $i$ is the stratigraphic position of each measurement. We assume that cyclic signals in $d$ is derived from orbital forcing and the record can therefore be tuned.
