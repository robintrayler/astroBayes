  abstract = {The teeth of many large herbivores contain ``pockets'' (fossettes, fossettids, etc.) which entrap impacted samples of food (dental boluses) during mastication. These do not preserve well in most fossil deposits, but at Rancho La Brea, paleobotanical remains survive essentially intact and dental boluses from late Pleistocene forms are amenable to microhistological analysis. Of the identifiable bolus contents, those from Bison antiquus averaged 87\% nonmonocotyledons; from Camelops hesternus, 90\% nonmonocotyledons; and from Equus occidentalis (one specimen), 56\% nonmonocotyledons. A control study on modern Bison bison shows that the boluses contain somewhat lower percentages of monocotyledons than do alimentary samples from the same individuals. However, this accounts for only a part of the very high percentage of nonmonocotyledons in the boluses of the extinct Bison. We conclude that the populations of B. antiquus and C. hesternus represented at Rancho La Brea probably fed little on grasses and that there is enough indirect evidence to suggest that the same may be true for other populations of these taxa. The Equus data are not sufficient to do more than question the usual assumption that Pleistocene horses were always obligate grass eaters.}

Wolf and coyote diets differed in frequency of occurrence of prey species during 3 of the 4 summers and winters (P \&lt; 0.001) during the study. Coyote diets contained more murid prey items, and wolf diets contained more deer (Odocoileus virginianus and O. hemionus) in the summer and elk (Cervus elaphus) in the winter. Coyotes and wolves ate prey of different size during both the summer (P \&lt; 0.001) and winter (P \&lt; 0.001) months in 1994\textendash 1996: wolves took a greater proportion (P \&lt; 0.001) of large (\&gt;45 kg) prey species and coyotes, small (\&lt;2 kg) prey (P \&lt; 0.001). Wolves selected a larger proportion of adults (P \&lt; 0.001), whereas coyotes selected a larger proportion of juveniles (P \&lt; 0.001) during summer. We believe that differential use of food resources facilitates coexistence of wolves and coyotes in the North Fork of the Flathead area.}

  abstract = {Early-life dietary transitions reflect fundamental aspects of primate evolution and are important determinants of health in contemporary human populations. Weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates; early weaning can have detrimental health effects but enables shorter inter-birth intervals, which influences population growth. Uncovering early-life dietary history in fossils is hampered by the absence of prospectively validated biomarkers that are not modified during fossilization. Here we show that large dietary shifts in early life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues. Teeth from human children and captive macaques, with prospectively recorded diet histories, demonstrate that barium (Ba) distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through the weaning process. We also document dietary transitions in a Middle Palaeolithic juvenile Neanderthal, which shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months, followed by seven months of supplementation. After this point, Ba levels in enamel returned to baseline prenatal levels, indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at 1.2 years of age. Integration of Ba spatial distributions and histological mapping of tooth formation enables novel studies of the evolution of human life history, dietary ontogeny in wild primates, and human health investigations through accurate reconstructions of breastfeeding history.},

  abstract = {Temporal stable isotope records derived from animal tissues are increasingly studied to determine dietary and climatic histories. Despite this, the turnover times governing rates of isotope equilibration in specific tissues following a dietary isotope change are poorly known. The dietary isotope changes recorded in the hair and blood bicarbonate of two adult horses in this study are found to be successfully described by a model having three exponential isotope pools. For horse tail hair, the carbon isotope response observed following a dietary change from a C3 to a C4 grass was consistent with a pool having a very fast turnover rate ( t1/2 approximately 0.5 days) that made up approximately 41\% of the isotope signal, a pool with an intermediate turnover rate ( t1/2 approximately 4 days) that comprised approximately 15\% of the isotope signal, and a pool with very slow turnover rate ( t1/2 approximately 140 days) that made up approximately 44\% of the total isotope signal. The carbon isotope signature of horse blood bicarbonate, in contrast, had a different isotopic composition, with approximately 67\% of the isotope signal coming from a fast turnover pool ( t1/2 0.2 days), approximately 17\% from a pool with an intermediate turnover rate ( t1/2 approximately 3 days) and approximately 16\% from a pool with a slow turnover rate ( t1/2 approximately 50 days). The constituent isotope pools probably correspond to one exogenous and two endogenous sources. The exogenous source equates to our fast turnover pool, and the pools with intermediate and slow turnover rates are thought to derive from the turnover of metabolically active tissues and relatively inactive tissues within the body, respectively. It seems that a greater proportion of the amino acids available for hair synthesis come from endogenous sources compared to the compounds undergoing cellular catabolism in the body. Consequently, the isotope composition of blood bicarbonate appears to be much more responsive to dietary isotope changes, whereas the amino acids in the blood exhibit considerable isotopic inertia.},

  abstract = {One of the great debates about extinction is whether humans or climatic change caused the demise of the Pleistocene megafauna. Evidence from paleontology, climatology, archaeology, and ecology now supports the idea that humans contributed to extinction on some continents, but human hunting was not solely responsible for the pattern of extinction everywhere. Instead, evidence suggests that the intersection of human impacts with pronounced climatic change drove the precise timing and geography of extinction in the Northern Hemisphere. The story from the Southern Hemisphere is still unfolding. New evidence from Australia supports the view that humans helped cause extinctions there, but the correlation with climate is weak or contested. Firmer chronologies, more realistic ecological models, and regional paleoecological insights still are needed to understand details of the worldwide extinction pattern and the population dynamics of the species involved.},

  abstract = {The biggest mass extinction of the past 600 million years (My), the end-Permian event (251 My ago), witnessed the loss of as much as 95\% of all species on Earth. Key questions for biologists concern what combination of environmental changes could possibly have had such a devastating effect, the scale and pattern of species loss, and the nature of the recovery. New studies on dating the event, contemporary volcanic activity, and the anatomy of the environmental crisis have changed our perspectives dramatically in the past five years. Evidence on causation is equivocal, with support for either an asteroid impact or mass volcanism, but the latter seems most probable. The extinction model involves global warming by 6\textdegree C and huge input of light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system from the eruptions, but especially from gas hydrates, leading to an ever-worsening positive-feedback loop, the `runaway greenhouse'.}

Studies examining cynodont morphology and anatomy have shown that these animals acquired increasingly mammal-like characteristics during their evolution. In this study, we use Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy to assess the enamel structure of several Triassic cynodonts. Extant Crocodylus niloticus and Varanus enamel spectra as well as published extant and fossil mammalian data were used as comparisons. The profiles of the cynodont spectra resemble biological apatite, in spite of their great age. The ratio of structural carbonate to phosphate in these cynodonts is significantly higher than in the extant and fossil mammals, but very similar to the extant reptiles. We suggest that the enamel apatite structure of these cynodonts was more similar to the reptilian rather than the mammalian pattern.},

  abstract = {Skeletal-injury frequency and distribution are likely to reflect hunting behaviour in predatory vertebrates and might therefore differ between species with distinct hunting modes. Two Pleistocene predators from the Rancho La Brea asphalt seeps, the sabre-tooth cat, Smilodon fatalis, and dire wolf, Canis dirus, represent ambush and pursuit predators, respectively. On the basis of a collection of over 1,900 pathological elements, the frequency of traumatic injury across skeletal elements in these two species was calculated. Here we show that the frequency of trauma in the sabre-tooth cat exceeds that of the dire wolf (4.3\% compared to 2.8\%), implying that the killing behaviour of S. fatalis entailed greater risk of injury. The distribution of traumatic injuries also differed between the two species. S. fatalis, an ambush predator, was injured more often than expected across the lumbar vertebrae and shoulders whereas C. dirus, a pursuit predator, had higher than expected levels of injury in the limbs and cervical vertebrae. Spatial analysis was used to quantify differences in the distribution of putative hunting injuries. Analysis of injury locations discriminated true hotspots from injury-dense areas and facilitated interpretation of predatory behaviour, demonstrating the use of spatial analyses in the study of vertebrate behaviour and evolution. These results suggest that differences in trauma distribution reflect distinct hazards of each species' hunting mode.}

  abstract = {The Rancho La Brea locality is world famous for asphaltic deposits that trapped and preserved late Pleistocene megafauna over the last 50,000\,years. This wealth of paleontological data allows for detailed investigation into paleoecological changes through the last glacial maximum into the Holocene. Here, we used dental mesowear analyses to infer dietary behavior in Bison antiquus, Equus occidentalis, and Camelops hesternus from five deposits (``pits'') spanning the latest Pleistocene: Pits 77, 91, 13, 3, and 61/67. Mesowear was compared among pits for each taxon and discriminant function and posterior probability analyses were conducted using a modern dataset to predict dietary categories at Rancho La Brea. Published mesowear scores from late Pleistocene Bison, Equus and Camelops from other localities were included in the discriminant function and posterior probability analyses to assess dietary variability among regions. Mesowear for each taxon did not differ among pits. Posterior probabilities and discriminant function analyses recovered E. occidentalis as a strict grazer with B. antiquus and C. hesternus recovered as mixed feeders. The stability of mesowear scores through the latest Pleistocene suggests average diets of these herbivores did not significantly change at Rancho La Brea. This is in contrast to documented changes in climate and flora proxies of southern California. However, it is unclear whether these proxies are representative of climate and floral changes at Rancho La Brea. Mesowear scores from late Pleistocene populations of Equus, Bison, and Camelops indicate little variability in diet in Equus, modest variability in Bison, and high variability in Camelops. These analyses suggest large ungulates may have been more opportunistic in their feeding strategies and highlights the need for using multiple proxies to clarify dietary behavior of herbivores},

  abstract = {Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of ecological processes and changes in~community composition. Our results show that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.}

  abstract = {The isotopic record preserved in mammalian enamel is a key source of data for reconstructing paleoenvironments and animal behavior. Serial sampling (i.e., drilling samples of enamel at increments perpendicular to the height axis of the tooth and parallel to the occlusal plane) is a prevalent method for assessing environmental seasonality or seasonality in the feeding behavior of fossil mammals. Most such studies assume comparatively minimal time averaging; few studies have attempted to empirically determine how much time is represented in these serial samples. Here, we employ a novel method to determine how much time is represented by serial samples from a published data set of late Pleistocene Equus and Bison teeth from Rancho La Brea, California. In common with other such studies, the original study estimated that each sample represented approximately one month of prism formation. To test this hypothesis, specimens were microCT scanned, sampling tracks or troughs were reconstructed, and dimensions of the enamel removed were measured for 157 samples. On average, each trough was found to have been sampled to a depth that removed approximately 114 days of enamel growth, and no sample represented fewer than 57 days. The depth of the troughs was always uneven, and the deepest portions of the trough sampled {$>$} 6 months of enamel prism formation. Given this amount of time averaging, the variability observed in the published values cannot necessarily be interpreted simply as seasonal variation. The high degree of time averaging in samples can also explain the lack of variation observed in some teeth. Thus, both claims of seasonal signal or lack of a seasonal signal in the data may be a function of sampling rather than climatic or behavioral processes affecting isotopic values. Our data highlight the necessity of considering taxon-specific rates of enamel prism formation and geometry of prism growth in designing and implementing sampling schemes for isotopic studies. Enamel growth rates and prism geometry should not be inferred from isotopic values or simply assumed from overall crown growth times, when they can be measured with greater precision using standard histologic methods.}

We aimed to quantify such partitioning in Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, breeding at South Georgia, which hosts \textasciitilde 95\% of the world's population. Whiskers were collected from 20 adult males and 20 adult females and stable isotope ratios were quantified every 5\,mm along the length of each whisker. Nitrogen isotope ratios ({$\delta$}15N) were used as proxies for trophic position and carbon isotope ratios ({$\delta$}13C) indicated foraging habitat. Sexual segregation was evident: {$\delta$}13C values were significantly lower in males than females, indicating males spent more time foraging south of the Polar Front in maritime Antarctica. In males {$\delta$}13C values declined with age, suggesting males spent more time foraging south throughout ontogeny. In females {$\delta$}13C values revealed two main foraging strategies: 70\% of females spent most time foraging south of the Polar Front and had similar {$\delta$}15N values to males, while 30\% of females spent most time foraging north of the Polar Front and had significantly higher {$\delta$}15N values. This niche partitioning may relax competition and ultimately elevate population carrying capacity with implications for ecology, evolution and conservation.}

  abstract = {Oxygen isotope compositions of fossil equid teeth in the Cascade rainshadow reveal a similar to5parts per thousand decrease in mean delta(18)O since 27 Ma. Isotopic changes are inconsistent with expected effects from global climate change because: (a) the expected isotopic shift to tooth delta(18)O values due to global climate change (similar to1parts per thousand) is much smaller than the observed shift, (b) predicted and observed isotopic trends are opposite for Oligocene vs. Miocene samples, and (c) average compositions and ranges in compositions remained unchanged for samples from before and after major global cooling in the mid-Miocene. Accounting for a decrease in relative humidity of at least 15\%, we infer a topographically driven secular shift in the delta(18)O value of rainwater of 6-8parts per thousand since the late Oligocene, which is approximately equivalent to the modem-day difference in delta(18)O values of precipitation and surface waters across the central Cascades. Rise of the central Cascades apparently occurred monotonically over the last 27 Ma, with a hiatus between similar to15.4 and 7.2 Ma, possibly related to eruption of the Columbia River Basalts. Progressive volcanic accumulation over tens of millions of years best explains the data, rather than a short-lived uplift event. Paleoseasonality, as inferred from isotope zoning and intertooth variability, decreased dramatically from 7-9parts per thousand at 15.4-7 Ma to similar to3parts per thousand at 3 Ma, then increased to 6-8parts per thousand today. The cause of the decrease in seasonality at 3 Ma may reflect either brief warming during the mid-Pliocene within the context of global tectonic reorganization, or consumption by equids of water from an isotopically buffered Lake Idaho.

  abstract = {We investigate if and how diets of gray wolves from the Yukon Territory, Canada, have changed from the Pleistocene ({$>$}52.8~ka BP to 26.5~ka BP [{$\pm$}170 y BP]) to the recent Holocene (1960s) using dental microwear analysis of carnassial teeth and stable isotope analyses of carbonates ({$\delta$}13CCO3 and {$\delta$}18OCO3) and collagen ({$\delta$}13Ccol and {$\delta$}15Ncol) from bone. We find that dental microwear patterns are similar between the Pleistocene and Holocene specimens, indicating that there has been no change in carcass utilization behaviours, where flesh, not bone, is primarily consumed. Based on minimal changes in {$\delta$}13CCO3 and {$\delta$}13Ccol values, we find that, over thousands of years, Yukon gray wolves have remained generalist predators feeding upon several large ungulate species. Interestingly, {$\delta$}15Ncol values suggest that the extinction of megafaunal species at \textasciitilde 11.7 Ka induced a shift from a diet comprised primarily of horse (Equus sp.) to one based on cervids (i.e. moose and caribou). Survival of large-bodied cervids, such as caribou (Rangifer tarandus), was likely key to wolf survival. Although gray wolves survived the end Pleistocene megafauna extinction and demonstrate a degree of ecological flexibility, we suggest that failure to preserve major elements of their current niche (e.G. caribou) may result in continued population declines, especially in the face of increasing anthropogenic influences.},

  abstract = {The water cycle in the western United States changed dramatically over glacial cycles. In the past 20,000 years, higher precipitation caused desert lakes to form which have since dried out. Higher glacial precipitation has been hypothesized to result from a southward shift of Pacific winter storm tracks. We compared Pacific Ocean data to lake levels from the interior west and found that Great Basin lake high stands are older than coastal wet periods at the same latitude. Westerly storms were not the source of high precipitation. Instead, air masses from the tropical Pacific were transported northward, bringing more precipitation into the Great Basin when coastal California was still dry. The changing climate during the deglaciation altered precipitation source regions and strongly affected the regional water cycle.},

  abstract = {Many scientific publications about stable isotope ratios suffer from flawed practices regarding calibration and normalisation of raw delta values in conjunction with prescribed delta values of reference materials. Violations of the identical treatment principle with regards to samples and standards (i.e. reference materials) and lack of adherence to SI-mandated and IUPAC-recommended nomenclature exacerbate the widespread problem of lackadaisical analytical practice and reporting. Science is supposed to strive for exactness, whereas ambiguity and jargon confound interdisciplinary communication. This contribution aims to expose typical misconceptions and avoidable errors and offers guidance toward the reproducible generation of isotope data, isotopic scale normalisation, and proper data reporting. We offer a comprehensive overview of sources of light stable isotope reference materials to best match sample matrices encountered by stable isotope practitioners with chemically similar reference materials.},

  abstract = {While the lagerst\"atte Rancho La Brea in California, USA has yielded millions of specimens, fossiliferous asphaltic deposits (``tar pits'' or ``breas'') are globally rare, with {$<$}15 localities. In the neotropics, such deposits represent opportunities for preservation in otherwise challenging tropical climates. The Caribbean island of Trinidad contains the largest natural asphalt deposit in the world and has a fragmentary record of brief excavations in the early-mid 1900s. We integrated information from collections databases with archival research and field surveys to verify localities, reconstruct taphonomic scenarios, and compile the first comprehensive Pleistocene faunal record for terrestrial Trinidad. To guide interpretations of this poorly sampled region, we conducted a quantitative synthesis of megafaunal mammal abundance data from all known ``tar pits'' of the western hemisphere, including metrics for sampling coverage and ecological diversity. Based on these metrics, condition of skeletal material, and descriptions of geology, we suggest that the megafaunal remains from Trinidadian localities represent secondary asphaltic preservation, in which hydrocarbons infiltrated in-situ Pleistocene bone beds, thus guiding future excavation approaches. The orders Cingulata, Pilosa, Proboscidea and Rodentia are represented, with genera that are ecologically consistent with the former savanna connection of Trinidad and Venezuela. Using this information, we infer the Quaternary biogeographic and paleoenvironmental history of Trinidad and demonstrate sized-biased extinctions. Finally, we identify interdisciplinary opportunities to study the actualistic taphonomy and ecology of active asphalt seeps today. Our study contributes both to our understanding of the paleoecology of the Caribbean and northern South America, as well as ``tar pits'' globally.},

  abstract = {The gray wolf (Canis lupus) exhibits both genetic and morphologic clinal variation across North America. Although shape variation in wolf populations has been documented, no study has been made to exhaustively quantify it, or to correlate morphologic variation with environmental variables. This study utilizes a large historical database of wolf skull linear measurements to analyze shape, and attempts to correlate it with wolf ecology. A variety of statistical tests are employed; size and shape are examined through a principal component analysis and a calculation of allometry vectors. Multiple regression analysis (both global and stepwise) are then used to test the resulting principal components against various biotic and abiotic factors. In addition, the effects of sexual dimorphism and taxonomy on morphology are explored through 1-way analysis of variance and canonical variates analysis, respectively. Several patterns are revealed, including size increase with latitude in accord with Bergmann's rule. Static allometry is significant, the fundamental pattern being a decrease in the robusticity of the basicranium relative to the viscerocranium. Sexual dimorphism, allometry, and a correlation with precipitation are other key factors driving morphological variation. Examination of these patterns has allowed us to make conclusions about the direct and indirect ways the environment has affected clinal variation in wolves.}

  abstract = {Dire wolves are considered to be one of the most common and widespread large carnivores in Pleistocene America1, yet relatively little is known about their evolution or extinction. Here, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of dire wolves, we sequenced five genomes from sub-fossil remains dating from 13,000 to more than 50,000~years ago. Our results indicate that although they were similar morphologically to the extant grey wolf, dire wolves were a highly divergent lineage that split from living canids around 5.7~million years ago. In contrast to numerous examples of hybridization across Canidae2,3, there is no evidence for gene flow between dire wolves and either North American grey wolves or coyotes. This suggests that dire wolves evolved in isolation from the Pleistocene ancestors of these species. Our results also support an early New World origin of dire wolves, while the ancestors of grey wolves, coyotes and dholes evolved in Eurasia and colonized North America only relatively recently.}

  abstract = {Intraspecific phenotypic variation in ecologically important traits is widespread and important for evolutionary processes, but its effects on community and ecosystem processes are poorly understood. We use life history differences among populations of alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus, to test the effects of intraspecific phenotypic variation in a predator on pelagic zooplankton community structure and the strength of cascading trophic interactions. We focus on the effects of differences in (1) the duration of residence in fresh water (either seasonal or year-round) and (2) differences in foraging morphology, both of which may strongly influence interactions between alewives and their prey. We measured zooplankton community structure, algal biomass, and spring total phosphorus in lakes that contained landlocked, anadromous, or no alewives. Both the duration of residence and the intraspecific variation in foraging morphology strongly influenced zooplankton community structure. Lakes with landlocked alewives had small-bodied zooplankton year-round, and lakes with no alewives had large-bodied zooplankton year-round. In contrast, zooplankton communities in lakes with anadromous alewives cycled between large-bodied zooplankton in the winter and spring and small-bodied zooplankton in the summer. In summer, differences in feeding morphology of alewives caused zooplankton biomass to be lower and body size to be smaller in lakes with anadromous alewives than in lakes with landlocked alewives. Furthermore, intraspecific variation altered the strength of the trophic cascade caused by alewives. Our results demonstrate that intraspecific phenotypic variation of predators can regulate community structure and ecosystem processes by modifying the form and strength of complex trophic interactions.},

The extirpation of wolves (Canis lupus) from Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1920s and their reintroduction in 1995 provided the opportunity to examine the cascading effects of carnivore\textendash herbivore interactions on woody browse species, as well as ecological responses involving riparian functions, beaver (Castor canadensis) populations, and general food webs. Our results indicate that predation risk may have profound effects on the structure of ecosystems and is an important constituent of native biodiversity. Our conclusions are based on theory involving trophic cascades, predation risk, and optimal foraging; on the research literature; and on our own recent studies in Yellowstone National Park. Additional research is needed to understand how the lethal effects of predation interact with its nonlethal effects to structure ecosystems.}

  abstract = {This study presents a stable isotope hydrology and geochemical analysis in the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the USA. Isotope ratios were used to estimate mean transit times (MTTs) in natural and human-altered watersheds using the FLOWPC program. Isotope ratios in precipitation resulted in a regional meteoric water line of delta(2)H = 7.42.delta(18)O + 0.88 (n = 316; r(2) = 0.97). Isotope compositions exhibited a strong temperature-dependent seasonality. Despite this seasonal variation, the stream delta(18)O variation was small. A significant regression (tau = 0.11D(-1.09); r(2) = 0.83) between baseflow MTTs and the damping ratio was found. Baseflow MTTs ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 years (human-altered), 0.7 to 1.7 years (mining-altered), and 0.7 to 3.2 years (forested). Greater MTTs were represented by more homogenous aqueous chemistry whereas smaller MTTs resulted in more dynamic compositions. The isotope and geochemical data presented provide a baseline for future hydrological modelling in the inland PNW.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances can constrain the realized niche space of wildlife by inducing avoidance behaviors and altering community dynamics. Human activity might contribute to reduced partitioning of niche space by carnivores that consume similar resources, both by promoting tolerant species while also altering behavior of species (e.g. activity patterns). We investigated the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on habitat and dietary niche breadth and overlap among competing carnivores, and explored if altered resource partitioning could be explained by human-induced activity shifts. To describe the diets of coyotes, bobcat, and gray foxes, we designed a citizen science program to collect carnivore scat samples in low- (?wildland?) and high- (?interface?) human-use open space preserves, and obtained diet estimates using a DNA metabarcoding approach. Habitat use was determined at scat locations. We found that coyotes expanded habitat and dietary niche breadth in interface preserves, whereas bobcats and foxes narrowed both niche breadth measures. High human use was related to increased dietary niche overlap among all mesocarnivore pairs, increased coyote habitat overlap with bobcats and foxes, and a small reduction in habitat overlap between bobcats and foxes. The strongest increase in diet overlap was among coyotes and foxes, which was smaller in magnitude than their habitat overlap increase. Finally, coyote scats were more likely to contain nocturnal prey in interface preserves, whereas foxes appeared to reduce consumption of nocturnal prey. Our results suggest that dominant and generalist mesocarnivores may encroach on the niche space of subordinate mesocarnivores in areas with high human activity, and that patterns in resource use may be related to human-induced activity shifts.},

  abstract = {Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) has been instrumental in reconstructing dietary ecology of extinct and extant carnivorans. Current sampling methods for canids focus on lower second molars (m2), where the grinding of flesh and bone captures dental microwear indicative of diet. However, dental microwear on other biomechanically analogous grinding facets (i.e. the talonid basin on the lower carnassial, m1) might be comparable and could help dramatically increase sample sizes of fossil specimens, as carnassials are more frequently recovered and identifiable than lower m2s. Here, we quantify the degree to which dental microwear textures between grinding facets on lower first and second molars are similar in two species of extant canids, coyotes (Canis latrans) and gray wolves (Canis lupus). Casts of paired m1s and m2s for each individual were sampled from museum collections and analyzed for three microwear parameters that correlate with diet in carnivorans: anisotropy, complexity, and textural fill volume. Within wolves, the m1 talonid and m2 are indistinguishable in all DMTA parameters. In coyotes, grinding facets of the m1 talonid and m2 are indistinguishable in complexity and textural fill volume, but anisotropy values of m1s are significantly lower than those of m2s. Differences in anisotropy between species were unlikely to be driven by biomechanical shifts in bite force between the m1 talonid and m2, but could stem from a combination of subtle morphological variation and intra-tooth variation. Overall, these data suggest that regions across molars with similar functions yield similar dental microwear textures. Finally, to demonstrate the effect of increased sample size, we show how the combination of DMTA data from lower m1 talonids and lower m2s of the hypocarnivorous Phlaocyonini canids from the John Day Formation of eastern Oregon, USA, alters the size and shape, but not position, of their reconstructed dietary ``niche'' space and hence interpretations about dietary behavior.},

  abstract = {The use of stable carbon isotopes as a means of studying energy flow is increasing in ecology and paleoecology. However, secondary fractionation and turnover of stable isotopes in animals are poorly understood processes. This study shows that tissues of the gerbil (Meriones unguienlatus) have different \OE\textyen{} 13C values when equilibrated on corn (C,\c{C}\~N) or wheat (C,\c{C}\'E) diets with constant 13C/12C contents. Lipids were depleted 3.0,\"A{$\infty$} and hair was enriched 1.0,\"A{$\infty$} relative to the C,\c{C}\~N diet. Tissue \OE\textyen{} 13C values were ranked hair {$>$} brain {$>$} muscle {$>$} liver {$>$} fat. After changing the gerbils to a wheat (C,\c{C}\'E) diet, isotope ratios of the tissues shifted in the direction of the \OE\textyen{} 13C value of the new diet. The rate at which carbon derived from the corn diet was replaced by carbon derived from the wheat diet was adequately described by a negative exponential decay model for all tissues examined. More metabolically active tissues such as liver and fat had more rapid turnover rates than less metabolically active tissues such as hair. The half-life for carbon ranged from 6.4 days in liver to 47.5 days in hair. The results of this study have important implications for the use of \OE\textyen{} 13C values as indicators of animal diet. Both fractionation and turnover of stable carbon isotopes in animal tissues may obscure the relative contributions of isotopically distinct dietary components (such as C,\c{C}\'E vs. C,\c{C}\~N, or marine vs. terrestrial) if an animal's diet varies through time. These complications deserve attention in any study using stable isotope ratios of animal tissue as dietary indicators and might be minimized by analysis of several tissues or products covering a range of turnover times.}

  abstract = {Recent advances in genomics and palaeontology have begun to unravel the complex evolutionary history of the gray wolf, Canis lupus. Still, much of their phenotypic variation across time and space remains to be documented. We examined the limb morphology of the fossil and modern North American gray wolves from the late Quaternary (\&lt;ca 70 ka) to better understand their postcranial diversity through time. We found that the late-Pleistocene gray wolves were characterized by short-leggedness on both sides of the Cordilleran\textendash Laurentide ice sheets, and that this trait survived well into the Holocene despite the collapse of Pleistocene megafauna and disappearance of the `Beringian wolf' from Alaska. By contrast, extant populations in the Midwestern USA and northwestern North America are distinguished by their elongate limbs with long distal segments, which appear to have evolved during the Holocene possibly in response to a new level or type of prey depletion. One of the consequences of recent extirpation of the Plains (Canis lupus nubilus) and Mexican wolves (C. l. baileyi) from much of the USA is an unprecedented loss of postcranial diversity through removal of short-legged forms. Conservation of these wolves is thus critical to restoration of the ecophenotypic diversity and evolutionary potential of gray wolves in North America.}

  abstract = {Oxygen isotope and major element zoning patterns of several disparate ungulate teeth were collected to evaluate the timing and geometry of enamel formation, records of isotope zoning, and tooth enamel sampling strategies. Isotopic zoning in mammalian tooth enamel encodes a sub-annual time series of isotopic variation of an animal's body water composition, with a damping factor that depends on the specifics of how enamel mineralizes. Enamel formation comprises two stages: precipitation of appositional enamel with a high CO3: PO4 ratio, followed by precipitation of maturational enamel with a lower CO3: PO4. If appositional and maturational enamel both contribute to isotope compositions (but with different CO3: PO4), and if isotope compositions vary seasonally, paired delta O-18 values from CO3 and PO4 profiles should show a spatial separation. CO3 isotope patterns should be shifted earlier seasonally than PO4 isotope patterns. Such paired profiles for new and published data show no resolvable shifts, i.e. CO3 and PO4 delta O-18 profiles show coincident maxima and minima. This coincidence suggests that enamel maturation reequilibrates appositional isotope compositions. If enamel maturation establishes enamel isotope compositions, the geometry of maturation, not apposition, should be considered when devising sampling protocols. X-ray maps of Ca zoning show that the majority of enamel (inner and middle layers) mineralizes heavily at a high angle to the external tooth surface and the enamel-dentine junction over length scales of 2-4 mm, while the outer enamel surface mineralizes more slowly. These data suggest that isotopic sampling strategies should parallel maturational geometry and focus on interior enamel to improve data fidelity. The magnitude of isotopic damping is also smaller than implied in previous studies, so tooth enamel zoning more closely reflects original body water isotopic variations than previously assumed.
